This application helps you manage invoices in a simple and clear way.

You can create invoices by adding multiple items, each with a description, quantity, and price.

The program makes sure that the names, quantities, and prices you enter are valid and guides you if something is wrong.

When you view invoices, they are displayed with clear formatting, showing totals and VAT (21%).

If you need to find a specific invoice, you can search by its unique ID.

And if you want to remove an invoice, the app will ask for confirmation before deleting it.

All data is saved in a JSON file so your invoices are kept safe between sessions.

The interface works through the console and guides you step-by-step with simple prompts.
